Manual Summaries of Reviews Written in Brazilian Portuguese
----------------------------------------------------------------

We created a set of manual summaries (abstractive and extractive) from 2 review sources, written in Brazilian Portuguese. 
The first one is ReLi (Freitas et al., 2012), a corpus that contains reviews of 13 books, and the second one is a set of reviews of 4 electronic products that were collected from the Buscapé website (http://www.buscape.com.br/). 
For each book and electronic product, we used 10 randomly chosen reviews.

In total, we created 170 manual summaries (85 abstractives and 85 extractives). For each book and electronic product, we created 5 abstractive and 5 extractive summaries.  

The materials used in the annotation and the summaries generated are contained in three folders: Material_Anotacao, Sumarios and Textos_Fontes.

- Material_Anotacao
This folder contains the Manual of Annotation and the reviews used to create the summaries. The reviews of each book and electronic product are stored in one file. In each file, it is provided the information about the id of the review (e.g., "Documento_20") and the id of the sentences (e.g., "<D20_S3>", which stands for sentence 3 of the "Documento_20" review).

- Textos_Fontes 
This folder is divided into 17 sub-folders and each one represents one book or electronic product. Each sub-folder contains 10 reviews stored in different files. Each file contains a review with one sentence per line. The name of the file indicates the id of the review (e.g., "Documento_20").

- Sumarios
This folder contains the generated summaries. For each book and electronic product, we created 5 abstractive and 5 extractive summaries that are grouped in the folders "Abstrativos" and "Extrativos", respectively. For extractive summaries, the information about the id of the sentence is provided.
